<h2>
<a id="materials" class="anchor" href="#materials" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Materials</h2>

<p align="justify">The materials for this class will be uploaded on this page. It is entirely your responsibility to download them as needed. A brief description of these materials follows.</p>

<ul align="justify">
<li> The syllabus should be used as a reference throughout the year for important dates, including exams, and for course policies. </li>
<li> Lecture notes will be posted on this website, in the <a href="#schedule"> Schedule </a>section, as the semester progresses. While these notes form the foundation of my lectures, additional insights and details will be provided during class. </li>
<li> The lecture notes are designed to complement, not replace, the textbook. Their purpose is to guide you through new material more easily. It is your responsibility to thoroughly read both the notes and the corresponding textbook chapters. Ensure you identify the relevant sections and subsections in the textbook that align with the lecture notes. This constitutes your reading assignment for the semester. </li>
</ul>
                                                                                                                       
<h2>
<a id="grading" class="anchor" href="#grading" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Grading Policy</h2>

<p align="justify">Your grade in this class will be based on homeworks and exams, as detailed below.</p>
<ul align="justify">
<li> <b>Homeworks.</b> 
  <p>You will receive five assignments counting towards 20 % of the grade. The lowest homework score will be dropped, with the remaining four assignments weighted equally. </p>
  <p>For students in 5740, you may encounter one or two additional questions per assignment, which are required for 5740 but optional for 3740 (offering bonus points for 3740 students). </p>
  <p>Late homework submissions will incur a 20% penalty if submitted within 24 hours past the deadline; submissions beyond that will not be accepted. Solutions will be posted on the course website two days after the submission window closes. Please refer to the Course Schedule above for deadlines.</p> </li>
<li> <b>Midterms.</b>
  <p>There will be two in-class tests, each during regular lecture times, collectively accounting for 50% of your final grade. Both midterms will carry equal weight, and the schedule is provided in the Course Schedule above.</p>
  <p>Each test will cover the material discussed in class up to the exam date, including problems solved in lectures and all the homeworks due before the exam. I will provide an overview of the exam in class and post a detailed outline of the required materials before each test. </p>
  <p>All exams are closed-book, and the use of any electronic devices is strictly prohibited. This includes computers, calculators, cellphones, and other electronic gadgets.</p>
  <p><i>Students with approved extended time: please see the section on accommodations below.</i> </p> </li>
<li><b>Final project.</b> 
  <p align="justify">The final project for this course will be a take-home data analysis assignment, designed to be completed at the end of the semester. The project will require students to work in groups, and the datasets along with specific questions for analysis will be distributed around October 20th. Students are expected to form groups of 3 to 4 members. These groups should be finalized and approved by the instructor no later than November 1st. Any student who have not joined a group by this deadline will be assigned to a group by the instructor.</p>
  <p align="justify">The final report, which documents the results of your analysis, must be submitted as a PDF file by December 16th. If the report is submitted late, a 20% penalty will be applied if it is received within 24 hours after the deadline; reports submitted after this period will not be accepted. The report should be no longer than 8 pages, formatted in a standard style with a font size of 12. It should demonstrate the application of appropriate methods discussed throughout the course, present findings clearly, and provide accurate interpretations of the results.</p> 
  <p align="justify">All data analysis must be conducted using R or Python, and the scripts used in your analysis must be submitted alongside the report, although these scripts will not count towards the 8 pages limit. Your project will be graded based on the effective application of the appropriate methods, the clarity and organization of the report, the accuracy of the interpretations, and the reproducibility of your analysis using the provided scripts.</p>
  <p align="justify">This project is an integral part of the course and will allow you to apply the knowledge and skills you have developed throughout the semester in a practical and meaningful way. It is an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of the course material and your ability to conduct and present a thorough data analysis.</p>
  <p><i>There is no curving of grades in this class. Your final grade will be based entirely on your performance.</i></p> </li>
</ul>

<a id="disabilities" class="anchor" href="#disabilities" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Students with Disabilities</h2>

<p align="justify">Students with disabilities are encouraged to engage fully in this course, and your access needs are a priority. To ensure that your approved accommodations are arranged in a timely manner, you must request your accommodation letter via the SDS Student Portal by August 31st.</p>
<p align="justify">For students who are already registered with the Student Disability Services (SDS), please note that once you request your accommodation letter, it may take up to 48 hours for the letter to be processed and sent to me. If you are not yet registered with SDS, be aware that the process to register and receive new accommodations can take up to three weeks. Once approved, you will be able to request your accommodation letter for this course.</p>
<p align="justify">If you are approved for accommodations later in the semester, it is important that you request your accommodation letter as soon as possible to avoid any delays in receiving the necessary support.</p>

<a id="accommodations" class="anchor" href="#accommodations" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Students with Exam Accommodations</h2>

<p align="justify">Regarding exam accommodations, this course is participating in the Alternative Testing Program (ATP). All exams will be centrally managed by the ATP, and relevant information will be communicated through SDS-testing@cornell.edu and your SDS Student Portal. It is important to stay informed by reading these communications and visiting sds.cornell.edu/atp for additional details about the ATP process.</p>
<p align="justify">Starting in Fall 2023, students no longer need to request each individual exam. However, if you have an academic conflict with a scheduled exam time, you must submit an ”exam request form” in the SDS Student Portal. All requests for conflict exams must be submitted no later than 10 business days prior to the exam date, and conflict exams will be scheduled at standard times.</p>
<p align="justify">For all relevant information and to manage your accommodations, please visit the SDS Student Portal at sds.cornell.edu.</p>
